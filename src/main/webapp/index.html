        <h1>REST API for Mercado Libre's Technical Challenge</h1>
        <img src="images/sat.png" alt="" class="center">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In February of this year, I developed a Java web app as part of a 
            technical test for the E-commerce company Mercado Libre. I was 
            applying for a BackEnd Java Developer position on the enterprise, 
            and so the challenge consisted about building one REST API with Java
            and then hosting the web app on a cloud computing platform (I chose 
            Amazon Web Services for the job).

            The program's primary purpose is to intercept the location and the 
            message of a spaceship in distress through satellite communication. 
            There are three satellites besides the ship and we know the X and Y 
            coordinates of each one (the relevant area of space is represented 
            by a cartesian plane), we just have to input our estimates of the 
            distance between each one of the satellites and the spaceship, as 
            well as the help message received by each satellite (which is just a
            fragment of the actual message sent by the ship). Then if its 
            possible, the program will determine both the location and the 
            complete message of the endangered ship with the data entered.</p>
        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>We need a tool like <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to 
            generate HTTP requests to the URL of the site in which the app is 
            currently being hosted:</p>
        <p>http://restful-meli.sa-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com</p>
        <p>In order to input the required data for the program to function, we 
            have to send a POST request to 
            http://restful-meli.sa-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/topsecret 
            with the following info in JSON format on the request's body:</p>
        <p class="small">
            <br>[</br>
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "kenobi",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": <b>0.0</b>,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": [<b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, 
                     <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>]</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp},</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "skywalker",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": <b>0.0</b>,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": [<b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, 
                     <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>]</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp},</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "sato",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": <b>0.0</b>,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": [<b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, 
                     <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>]</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}</br>
            <br>]</br>
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards without modifying the name fields at all, we change the 
            values of the fields corresponding to the estimated distance between
            the satellites and the spaceship with other real numbers of our 
            choosing, and on the fields below with the empty quotes we add the 
            words of the message as obtained by each one of the satellites, like
            in this example:</p>
        <p class="small">
            <br>[</br>
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "kenobi",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": 663.4,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": ["this", "", "", "secret", ""]
                     </br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp},</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "skywalker",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": 264.7,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": ["", "is", "", "", "message"]</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp},</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"name": "sato",</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"distanceFromShip": 447.7,</br>
                     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                     &nbsp"receivedMessage": ["this", "", "a", "", ""]</br>
                 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}</br>
            <br>]</br>
        </p>
        <p>If the POST request is then sent without any issues, you should get a
            result similar to this one (which is what you'll get after inputting
            the data of the above example) with the location of the spaceship 
            and the full message emitted by it:</p>
        <p class="small"><br>x: 56.5</br>
        <br>y: 161.1</br>
        <br>message: this is a secret message</br></p>
        <p>It's also possible to enter the calculated distance from the ship and
            the collected message of a particular satellite by sending a POST 
            request to http://restful-meli.sa-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/topsecret_split/satellitename, 
            replacing "satellitename" at the end
            of the URL with the name of the satellite you want to add the data 
            to (which can only be kenobi, skywalker or sato as those three are 
            the only names available). Then the request body must be in JSON 
            format and with the following structure:</p>
        <p class="small">
            <br>{</br>
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"distanceFromShip": 
                <b>0.0</b>,</br>
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"receivedMessage": 
                [<b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>, <b>""</b>]</br>
            <br>}</br>
        </p>
        <p>After filling in the necessary data for each satellite with this 
            method, you have to send a GET request to 
            http://restful-meli.sa-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/topsecret_split 
            to obtain the final result.</p>
