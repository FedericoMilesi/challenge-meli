# REST API for Mercado Libre's Technical Challenge

In February of this year, I developed a Java web app as part of a technical test for the E-commerce company Mercado Libre. I was applying for a BackEnd Java Developer position, and so the challenge was about building a REST API with Java and then hosting the web app on a cloud computing platform (I chose Amazon Web Services for the task).
